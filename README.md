Phishing is a cyberattack method where attackers deceive users into providing sensitive information by pretending to be trustworthy entities. This attack commonly occurs through URLs that appear legitimate but lead users to malicious sites designed to harvest data like usernames, passwords, and financial details. With the rise of internet usage and online transactions, phishing has become one of the most challenging threats to cybersecurity.
Detecting phishing URLs in real-time is a critical challenge for cybersecurity, as it requires distinguishing malicious links from legitimate ones with high accuracy to prevent data breaches and financial losses. 

This project aims to address the issue of phishing by developing a deep learning-based phishing URL detection system and comparing 6 different classifiers based on their performance. 

By analyzing various features of URLs—such as domain information, length, special characters, and lexical properties—the system can accurately differentiate between legitimate and phishing URLs. Integrating this detection mechanism into platforms such as web browsers, email filters, and network firewalls can provide real-time protection against phishing attacks, significantly reducing the risk of data breaches and financial losses.

The phishing URL detection system successfully differentiates between legitimate and phishing URLs using various deep learning models. Among the models, XGBoost demonstrated the highest accuracy, making it well-suited for real-time phishing detection. 

This solution can be effectively integrated into web browsers and email filtering systems to enhance cybersecurity by identifying malicious URLs.
